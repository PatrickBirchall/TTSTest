The old lighthouse keeper gazed out at the stormy sea,
his weathered hands gripping the railing.
For fifty years, he had guided ships safely through these treacherous waters.
Tonight was different.
Through the howling wind, he heard an unfamiliar sound -
a haunting melody carried across the waves.
As he peered through the rain-streaked windows,
he spotted something impossible:
a ghostly ship, glowing with an ethereal blue light, sailing against the wind.
The keeper rubbed his eyes in disbelief,
but when he looked again,
both the ship and the mysterious song had vanished into the misty darkness.
