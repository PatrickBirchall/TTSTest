The Old Manor House

It was a cold autumn evening when Sarah first heard the whispers. She had just moved into the century-old manor house, a grand but deteriorating structure that stood alone at the end of Willow Street. The previous owners had sold it for a surprisingly low price, but Sarah hadn't questioned her good fortune.

That first night, as the wind rustled through the dying leaves outside, she sat in the dusty library organizing her books. The grandfather clock in the hall struck midnight, its deep chimes echoing through the empty rooms. That's when she heard it – a soft, barely audible whisper calling her name.

"Just the wind," she told herself, but the whispers grew clearer. They seemed to come from the walls themselves, accompanied by the subtle creaking of floorboards from the room above, though she lived alone.

Over the next few days, strange occurrences became more frequent. Books would fall from shelves without being touched. The temperature would drop suddenly in certain rooms, creating pockets of icy cold air. And always, always, there were the whispers.

One evening, while making tea in the kitchen, Sarah noticed a reflection in the window – not her own, but that of an elderly woman in Victorian dress, watching her with hollow eyes. When Sarah turned around, the kitchen was empty, but the air felt heavy with an unseen presence.

Unable to ignore the signs any longer, Sarah researched the house's history at the local library. What she discovered chilled her to the bone. In 1886, the lady of the house, Elizabeth Blackwood, had disappeared without a trace. According to local legend, her husband had walled her up alive in one of the rooms after discovering her affair with a young groundskeeper.

That night, Sarah woke to the sound of crying. Following the sound, she found herself in front of a wall in the library that seemed newer than the others. As she approached, the crying stopped, replaced by a single, clear whisper: "Help me."

Sarah backed away, her heart pounding. She knew then that she wasn't alone in the house – and never had been. Elizabeth Blackwood was still there, trapped between the walls of her former home, waiting for someone to finally set her free.

The next morning, Sarah packed her bags and left, leaving behind the old manor house and its secrets. But sometimes, on quiet nights, she still hears whispers calling her name, begging her to return and uncover the truth hidden within those ancient walls.
